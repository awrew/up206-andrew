**Reaction to “Geoff Boeing’s Presentation to Urban Planners”**

In watching Boeing’s presentation along with skimming his articles, I came away with three takeaways. One, I will weight “when” parts of cities were developed over “where” a city is developed to evaluate its urban form. This seems self-evident and it doesn’t come as a large surprise. However, when looking at maps in his articles that show city grids, it made what I’ve learned this past quarter all the more transparent. Plus, it’s fascinating to the layers of planning history in a city. 

Two, spatial data science is key to our future as planners. It’s a new framework that will serve as a cornerstone in how we examine, understand, and plan the future of our communities. Until this quarter, I’ve underestimated the applicability of spatial data science. 

Lastly, the work that goes into creating a platform like OSMnx takes time so it can evolve. Boeing didn’t know what the 20,000 lines of code would look like when he started. In his words, “it was Frankenstein’s monster.” In my words, “a crockpot has to cook, so let it cook.” Good ideas take time and can grow with input from others. The end result was a platform that made traditionally difficult mapping and analysis much easier.
