**About Me:** I'm a 2022 Masters of Urban and Regional Planning (MURP) candidate at UCLA focusing on community and regional economic development. My research interests are in the conditions that create sustainable, economically vibrant, and equitable communities. I have taken classes in grahic design, local and regional economic development, GIS and data science, and transportation and land use. If you are interested in collaborating, contact me at awwd.williams@gmail.com. 

**My projects interests for UP206A:**
  * Proximity of affordable housing to employment opportunities in a local or regional context
  * The effect of density or other features of new urbanism on other issues including but not limited to health outcomes, wage changes, and demographic changes
  * Usability of city and county services for those experiencing homelessness
  * Immediate and long-term effects of sports infrastructure on local communities e.g. new pro sports stadiums, Olympic host cities 
  * Basically anything including some combination of local or regional economic development, neighborhood change, equity, health outcomes, affordable housing, homelessness, or migration patterns
  * *The geographic scale of these project ideas are on a local or regional scale and can be either domestic or international*
