In John Lorinc’s “Civic leaders have more data than ever to guide their decisions, but the tech is not in charge,” he surveys how some innovative cities leverage granular urban data to inform neighborhood and city level policies. The planning profession has historically relied on data from public health concerns in the 1920s to contemporary transportation planners use of extensive surveys to produce travel demand forecasts. Data in the past century has only grown more sophisticated and granular. Smart data is the next tool that can help cities become more responsive and efficient in their planning and operational decision making. In Toronto for example, Google and Apple aggregated cellphone mobility data by location during the COVID-19 pandemic and their data revealed an increase in park usage. City-officials used this data to extend park-focused programs and services. In another example, the city of Stockholm has a project to use hyperlocal data to study conditions such as air and road quality by installing solar-powered sensors on city vehicles. However, there are questions on the effectiveness of granular urban data, concerns on how data can be leveraged for negative applications, and how to integrate data into public sector management. 

Upon reflection, I believe utilizing granular urban data will be instrumental in helping cities navigate complex problems. Is such data appropriate for every situation—no. Are there concerns regarding privacy as well as how this data can be used manipulated—of course. Having worked in public health and health care for the majority of my short lived career, access to accurate data gave my team insights on how we could improve the health of population subsets. Access to data for municipalities is no different and can be more robust. Granular data and geospatial analysis will shed light on how residents experience their neighborhood and the larger metropolitan area. Where and how such data can be used needs to be tested and monitored to know its limits while also safeguarding individual privacy. In sum, data science is another tool planners can add to their repertoire. I’m eager to learn how to leverage this tool to offer a deeper analysis of how we can better plan cities around residents’ needs.
